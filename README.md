# Face_detection-and-Recognition
_**Project Summary:**_

_This project implements a face detection and recognition system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It aims to identify or verify individuals from images or video streams._

_**Key Functionalities:**_

_**Real-time Face Detection:** Detects faces in real-time using algorithms like Haar Cascade Classifiers or deep learning models (e.g., MTCNN).
**Facial Feature Extraction:** Extracts key facial features (e.g., landmarks, embeddings) for recognition purposes.
**Face Recognition:** Recognizes known individuals by comparing extracted features with a pre-built database of faces and their corresponding identities.
**Facial Landmark Detection:** Detects specific facial landmarks (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) for further analysis or applications._

**Technologies Used:**

_Python
OpenCV (or dlib)
TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
NumPy
Scikit-learn (for traditional machine learning methods)
Git (for version control)_

**Further Development:**

_Explore the use of advanced face recognition models based on deep learning architectures (e.g., VGGFace2, FaceNet).
Implement functionalities for real-time video processing and face recognition in video streams.
Integrate the system with applications like access control systems or security monitoring systems._
